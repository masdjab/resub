1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,345
''B.''

2
00:00:33,505 --> 00:00:36,269
''A.''

3
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,924
Man:
You having fun, sweetheart?

4
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,822
Girl:
Yes.

5
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,213
Ahh.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,843
Well, I hope you're doing
better than me, baby.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,158
- What are you making?
- A necklace for Mom.

8
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:49,186
Yeah? Let me see.

9
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,343
Wow. Another one?

10
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,706
- Yes.
- Woman: honey?

11
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:55,351
That's two today.

12
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,070
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:58,499
honey?

14
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:01,009
- Yeah?
- Waiting for the help to get that?

15
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:03,657
I thought you and I were the help.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,247
- Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin.
- Okay.

17
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,624
Mmm, smells nice.
That takeout?

18
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:13,833
Mommy, look at-

19
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,760
No!

20
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,037
No! Ahh!

21
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:31,960
Oh! No no no!

22
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,323
You can't fight fate.

23
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:47,527
Man: We gotta get the fuck out of here.
Come on!

24
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:51,692
Oh! Oh no!

25
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:56,604
Thug:
No!

26
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:59,200
- What the fuck are you doing?
- No!

27
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,409
Fucking stop!
Let's go!

28
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:03,396
Just shut the fuck up!

29
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,907
No!

30
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:20,420
It's cool.

31
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:21,902
Kids like me.

32
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:24,797
No! heather!

33
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,780
No no!

34
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,771
- Nick.
- Bray, what's happenin'?

35
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:25,850
Willis is a rowing buddy of mine.
Where are we on his kid's case?

36
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,286
- Willis?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:29,016
- Oh, I kicked it down to juvie.
- Why did you do that?

38
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:30,903
'Cause the case was a dog.
The kid was only 15 years old

39
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:32,509
when he committed the murder.

40
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:35,250
You wouldn't want to jeopardize
your 95% conviction rate.

41
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:37,150
- It's actually 96%.
- 96% now?

42
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:39,432
Yes. You gotta keep your books
better than that.

43
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,532
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were gunning for my job.

44
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:44,987
You do know better.

45
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:47,269
And you know that I'm aiming
much higher than that.

46
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,707
Woman:
They filed a motion to dismiss,

47
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:51,496
but there's no way that
Judge Abrams honors it.

48
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:52,759
I think that we can
get him on RICO.

49
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:55,174
All that time and that's
what you come back with, Sarah?

50
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,893
You might want to reevaluate
your research skills.

51
00:03:58,058 --> 00:03:59,671
- What else have we got?
- Nick: She's right.

52
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:00,842
Mr. Rice?

53
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,319
RICO's designed
for this kind of thing.

54
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:04,662
Check out section 901 of
the Organized Crime Control Act.

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,813
And you should let Sarah
try this case too.

56
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,690
Mr. Rice, last I checked,
l was running this room.

57
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,948
She's already done the leg-work.
I'll oversee it.

58
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:13,695
I mean, Helen Keller
could try this case.

59
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,990
Okay, Boy Wonder,
she fucks up, it's on you.

60
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:25,292
Cantrell wants to see you.

61
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:26,617
All right, I'll be right there.

62
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:29,950
No, Nick.
he wants to see Nick.

63
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,543
Nick: Let's just say I'm less impressed
with his Harvard degree than he is.

64
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:35,879
Well, we can't all have
gone to Fordham.

65
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,174
I went to Fordham night school.

66
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:39,328
You know what I learned
in Fordham night school?

67
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,633
Law school's got nothing
to do with law.

68
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,825
Guess you skipped the course
on inter-office politics.

69
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:45,463
All I need is a jury to like me.
Isn't that what you told me, Jonas?

70
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:48,223
The Shelton case-
where are we?

71
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,915
It went sideways last night-
Judge Burch.

72
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,313
Ahh.

73
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:53,067
Bad news. What now?

74
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:55,681
- Let's make the deal.
- They killed a little girl, Nick.

75
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:58,434
- It's an imperfect system.
- And we its imperfect servants.

76
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:01,812
- however you could win this case.
- No, can't take that chance.

77
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:04,328
Some justice is better
than no justice at all.

78
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,319
You need to tell the husband.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,453
Okay.
That's part of my job.

80
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:11,269
Good, because he's waiting
for you right now.

81
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:12,912
What?

82
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,941
- how are you doing?
- Good. how are you doing?

83
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:26,414
Good. Sit. Sit.

84
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,840
Well, I didn't hear back from you

85
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,857
and made some notes
on the case.

86
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:34,635
I had some good ideas.

87
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,302
Yeah, let me
take a look at it.

88
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:39,335
Well, they're just-

89
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:46,227
I was gonna talk to you
about those.

90
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,299
Do you trust me?

91
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,854
Do you trust me, Clyde?

92
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:56,333
Yeah, of course.

93
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,653
Darby has agreed to testify
against Ames.

94
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:04,129
With Darby's testimony,

95
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:05,897
Ames will go
to death row.

96
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:13,145
Um, what about-
what about Darby then?

97
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,463
Darby will plead
guilty to murder.

98
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:19,030
- In what degree?
- Third.

99
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:21,386
he serves, what?
Five years...

100
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,872
at best?

101
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:26,636
I don't understand.
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:30,260
We had a setback. The judge ruled
that the DNA was inadmissible.

103
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:33,066
- What?
- Exclusionary rule.

104
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,864
The opposing counsel
maneuvered it.

105
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,001
You said this part of
the case was clear-cut.

106
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:38,484
We had the blood on his shirt-

107
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:40,135
It's covered under
the same rule.

108
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,525
What about the rest of
the forensic evidence?

109
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,928
It's not conclusive, Clyde.

110
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:49,982
Okay, that's okay.
'Cause I saw- I saw their faces.

111
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,891
I saw them do it.
l mean, he killed my little girl, Nick.

112
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,648
You blacked out, Clyde.
Your testimony won't be reliable.

113
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,275
You get on the stand and
the defense will tear you apart.

114
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:00,615
No no, the jury's gonna
believe me though.

115
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:03,578
- Because it's the truth! We can-
- We can lose.

116
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:06,225
And then we'd have nothing.

117
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:08,533
You will waste a whole year,
spend millions of dollars,

118
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:10,410
and then both of them could
end up going free.

119
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,764
Nick, both of them are guilty,
especially Darby!

120
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,740
- You know that.
- It's not what you know, Clyde.

121
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,059
It's what you can
prove in court.

122
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,718
Please don't make a deal
with this man.

123
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,707
Please don't make a deal with this man.
he's a monster-

124
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:28,125
I'm sorry, the deal is done.
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:29,910
I made the deal.

126
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:32,747
What?
how could you do that?

127
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:36,137
This is just how
the justice system works.

128
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,981
Listen, I know you don't
think it right now,

129
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:42,621
but this is a victory for us.

130
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,961
Woman: Your office has certified
this agreement?

131
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:49,252
Yes, Your honor.

132
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,918
Mr. Reynolds, any great insights
to share with the court today?

133
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,791
I'm a defense attorney, Your honor.
l don't have many of those.

134
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:01,422
No, Your honor.
No insights.

135
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:04,090
Good, then I trust that we can
move forward with Mr. Ames's trial

136
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:07,423
unimpeded by continuances.
A trial date is imminent.

137
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:11,883
Yeah?

138
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:14,205
There's no cell phones
in my courtroom, Mr. Rice.

139
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:15,567
- We've been over this-
- I'm sorry.

140
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:16,708
- and over this, over this...

141
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:19,296
Yeah, I had some
exigent business l-

142
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:21,199
Next time it's mine.

143
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,245
- Ah, you married?
- Excuse me?

144
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,211
Are you married?

145
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:33,829
Please fuck this up
so I can destroy you.

146
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,901
I wish ill for no man,

147
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,388
but Ames deserves to
suffer for what he did.

148
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:47,402
I mean, you can't
fight fate, right?

149
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:53,913
Nick.

150
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:56,390
Cantrell: Once you make a decision,
live with it- move on.

151
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:58,516
This job, your best asset's
a short memory.

152
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:01,408
Don't beat yourself up. Too many other
people out there doing that already.

153
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:02,685
Look, there's some of them
right now.

154
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:05,508
Isn't this where you tell me
some type of old fable

155
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:08,179
or wives' tale-

156
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,981
All right, all right, I got one.

157
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,881
Marcus Aurelius hired a servant
to walk behind him

158
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,458
as he made his way through
the Roman town square.

159
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:15,492
And this servant's only job

160
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:18,072
was to whisper in his ear
when people praised him,

161
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:21,179
''You're only a man.
You're only a man. ''

162
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:22,620
- Okay, man?
- Okay, man.

163
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:23,897
- Okay, man.
- That's some bullshit.

164
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:24,973
That's good.

165
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:26,264
Nick: I don't think you even know
what that story means.

166
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:28,333
You're missing the point, Nick.
It doesn't matter what they say.

167
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:29,861
Okay, I got this now.

168
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:35,088
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
one at a time, one at a time.

169
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:36,821
So you'll be seeking
the death penalty?

170
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:38,800
- For Rupert Ames, we will be.
- And for Darby?

171
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,201
he has pled guilty to murder,
but he is a cooperating witness.

172
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,500
The DA's office has committed
all of its resources

173
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:45,911
to ensure that justice
will be served.

174
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,572
Woman:
Did you make any kind of-

175
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,292
Man: Do you think this is
a fair sentence for Darby?

176
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,198
I just wanted to say
thanks for being in my corner.

177
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,091
It's nice when
the system works, right?

178
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:00,133
Get away from me.

179
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:02,421
Officer:
Move. Move.

180
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:08,960
Let's go.

181
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,721
- Nick?
- hey.

182
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,113
Nuh-uh, what happened?

183
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:54,285
What happened to what?

184
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,290
What's wrong?

185
00:10:58,235 --> 00:11:01,236
You call my job boring. ''C-''?

186
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,766
Yes.

187
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,595
Well...
okay now...

188
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,461
you gonna tell me
what's wrong?

189
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:11,808
Can I talk to my daughter
for a little bit?

190
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:14,628
- Oh, please. No no no.
- Gonna lay down.

191
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:16,909
Please?

192
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:18,954
First of all,
this is your father speaking.

193
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,666
- Yeah, she didn't know that.
- You never know.

194
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:23,328
I want you to stay in there
as long as you can.

195
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,458
'cause there's a lot
of crazy-ass people out here.

196
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:27,178
Language.

197
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,082
Your mother's a hardass, but-

198
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,360
I'm right here.

199
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,747
And Daddy- Daddy wants you to
come out and be Daddy's little girl.

200
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:37,327
Woman: I want her to come out
'cause she's on my bladder.

201
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:39,108
Nick: Ahh!

202
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,406
Anybody seen my phone?

203
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:49,366
- hey, have you seen my phone?
- It's not strapped to your hand?

204
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,287
No, it's not strapped to my hand.

205
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:52,993
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

206
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,452
You're not gonna have
some of my French toast?

207
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:56,189
- French toast? You made French toast?
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:58,950
I can't, honey.
I'm running late.

209
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,220
Okay.

210
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:03,156
All right, here- Mmm.

211
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,769
- Mmm, that's good.
- Thank you.

212
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:05,875
- You did this by yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:07,574
I'm just gonna take
this whole plate to work.

214
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:09,938
All right- no.

215
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:11,581
You're only 10 years old?

216
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,578
- You better than your mother.
- I heard that.

217
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:16,041
Smells good in here.
Your lifeline.

218
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,840
'Morning, baby.
Give me a kiss.

219
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,758
Mmm! You going to your daughter's
recital this afternoon?

220
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:25,157
Um, I thought you were gonna
order the DVDs.

221
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,833
Video's not the same, Nick.

222
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,704
Mom, it's okay.
Dad's got to work, I know.

223
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,444
See? It's all right. Dad's got to work.
And what is Dad doing today?

224
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:34,075
- Lock up bad guys.
- And why does he do that?

225
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:35,465
- To keep us safe.
- Yeah.

226
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,240
She understands.
'Cause he wants us to be safe.

227
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,001
- Baby, get your cello.
- All right.

228
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:42,007
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

229
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:44,765
- Little Julia Child.
- Mmm.

230
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:48,112
You know she's
10 years old, right?

231
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,389
- You know that?
- I know that.

232
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:50,937
She doesn't understand why
you're never around.

233
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:52,914
This good-guy, bad-guy stuff-
that's just talk to her.

234
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,534
Don't do this, come on.

235
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,253
I can't come today.

236
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:58,370
You know you have not been
to one recital-

237
00:12:58,537 --> 00:12:59,935
- how many has she had?
- Enough.

238
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,217
Okay.
Well, we'll get the video,

239
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,070
we'll sit down and we'll
watch it together as a family.

240
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:08,143
I love you.

241
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,464
All right?

242
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,502
- Thank you for the toast.
- Love you.

243
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:12,663
- Love you too!
- Bye.

244
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:14,561
Love you.

245
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:16,414
huh.

246
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:19,042
- So how's Chip?
- It's Chester.

247
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:20,444
What happened to Chip?
l liked Chip.

248
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:22,044
There is no Chip.

249
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,364
And now there's no Chester.
he kept calling.

250
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,632
- Sarah, that's a good thing.
- I know, but I kept canceling.

251
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,409
My caseload's crazy.

252
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:30,999
You know you don't have to
go to this if you don't want to.

253
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,437
Yeah, I do. l...

254
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:34,869
What's it like?

255
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,081
No biggie.
Like watching somebody fall asleep.

256
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,069
Except for
the not-waking-up part.

257
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:40,873
Does it bother you?

258
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,435
Not anymore.

259
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,805
Sarah, your legs are looking
real good in those heels.

260
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,721
Fuck off.

261
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:32,237
What are you doing here, Reynolds?
Your DVD player broken?

262
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,492
Ames has no family. I felt like
someone should be here for him.

263
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,827
Wow, that's nice.

264
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:42,502
Breathe.

265
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,143
Rupert Ames, do you have
anything you want to say?

266
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,962
Yeah.

267
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,253
Uh-huh.

268
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:10,487
Ames:
What I did that night was wrong.

269
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,049
I should have never been there.

270
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,379
But I swear to God,
l didn't kill those people.

271
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,328
The wrong man's dying here today.

272
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,997
The wrong man's dying.

273
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:32,038
That's all.

274
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:55,970
Look at me.

275
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:58,977
Look at me!

276
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:56,699
Ahh! Fuck!

277
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,926
Fuck!

278
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,789
Ahh! Fuck!

279
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:04,378
Oh, God.

280
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:07,546
- Oh, God.
- Take her- take her out.

281
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,707
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

282
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,480
Ahhh!

283
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:40,096
Man: What could have caused
the unexpected reaction of the inmate?

284
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,086
We'll keep you informed.

285
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:44,251
You okay? huh?

286
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:45,922
Yeah.

287
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,485
So somebody killed the guy
you were trying to kill?

288
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,769
What are we calling this?

289
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:52,379
Clear violation of his
Eighth Amendment rights-

290
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,153
- cruel and unusual punishment.
- Law school.

291
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,314
Yeah. The machine-
how does it work on a good day?

292
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,431
It's designed to be pain-free.

293
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,870
It's three drugs administered
in a specific order.

294
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,991
From this point on, we're operating
under the assumption

295
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:04,412
that the machine was corrupted.

296
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,199
We're gonna need a list of all
the people with access to that machine.

297
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,680
- My people would not do this.
- I appreciate that, Warden,

298
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:12,896
but I'm gonna need more than
a hall pass and a note from Mom.

299
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:14,886
Detectives, got this off
the back of the machine.

300
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:17,068
- Check it out.
- Let me see it.

301
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:18,985
Man: Right there.

302
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:20,784
''Can't fight fate. ''

303
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,469
Cantrell:
What is it, Nick?

304
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:24,640
During the home invasion,
Ames's accomplice

305
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,765
said to one of the vics,
''You can't fight fate. ''

306
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:29,872
And then he said the same thing
to me in the courtroom- prick.

307
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,488
I can't remember his name, though.

308
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:34,930
Detective: have a look at this-
your guy?

309
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:37,081
- Nick: Clarence James Darby.
- Detective: he's a cutie.

310
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:38,961
- You got history with him?
- Nick: Put him away.

311
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,107
There was extenuating
circumstances.

312
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:46,224
The only extenuating circumstances
should be he didn't do it.

313
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,837
Still, three years at Marion?
Fucking gladiator academy.

314
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:50,594
You expect him to come back
a model citizen?

315
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:52,940
Well, if you scholars wouldn't
contaminate the crime scenes,

316
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:54,340
I could keep them
locked up longer.

317
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,331
TV reporter: Authorities have refused
to comment at this point,

318
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:58,245
but foul play cannot be ruled out.

319
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,701
The prisoner had been on death row
for the past 10 years-

320
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,164
his name, Rupert Ames.

321
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,571
Female reporter:
All we know at this point

322
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,777
is what was supposed to be
a painless execution

323
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,453
has turned into something
out of a horror film.

324
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:15,963
Yeah?

325
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,989
- Disguised voice: Clarence Darby?
- Who's this?

326
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:20,877
That's strike three for you:
coke on the table,

327
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,338
bitch on the floor- life in prison.

328
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,616
Who the fuck is this?

329
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:29,227
Voice: Look out your window,
south side.

330
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,953
- ls this a joke? Get up!
- Ahh!

331
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,135
South side.

332
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:40,383
Motherfucker.

333
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:43,040
Shit. Out of the way!

334
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:55,902
- Stay down!
- You're all crazy!

335
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:58,533
he's heading north!
Go go!

336
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:01,201
- Damn.
- Move it, move it. Go on!

337
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:11,056
- What now?
- Wipe the prints off the gun.

338
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,104
- Get rid of it.
- No no.

339
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,625
You fired six times, genius.
You bring any ammunition?

340
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,320
- Lose it.
- Why are you doing this?

341
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:19,954
I want to keep you
out of prison.

342
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,609
See the abandoned factories?
Go toward them.

343
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:23,683
Why?

344
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:25,427
There's a cop car there
with a cop in it.

345
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:26,653
What the fuck?

346
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:29,154
I Tasered him, but he'll be waking up
in about 90 seconds,

347
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:30,959
so you'd better move.

348
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:50,079
Rise and fucking shine, bitch.
Wake the fuck up!

349
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:51,870
Let's go!
Start the fucking car!

350
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:53,010
- Okay!
- Do it.

351
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,230
- Take it easy, take it-
- Come on!

352
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:56,877
- Okay, let's go.
- Take it easy.

353
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:59,655
Let's go!
Get in gear, shithead, now!

354
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,923
Do it! Go go go!

355
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:17,925
Get the fuck out.

356
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:24,645
Let's go.

357
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,542
Get the fuck down there!

358
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:30,335
Okay. What about my wife?
My little girl?

359
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,373
- I'll never see them again.
- Fucked up, ain't it?

360
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:36,127
Oh oh oh.

361
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:38,456
You don't mind if
l take this, do you?

362
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:40,637
My guardian angel.

363
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:42,432
I am impressed.

364
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:46,255
You know why I'll never see
my wife and little girl again?

365
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,540
'Cause you took 'em from me.

366
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,021
You remember me?

367
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,265
Sure you do.

368
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:06,868
You came over to my house
once before.

369
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,861
You don't remember?

370
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:14,620
This tetrodotoxin...

371
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,798
should be nicely into
your system by now.

372
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,330
It's isolated from the liver
of a Caribbean puffer fish.

373
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,716
So it paralyzes you,

374
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:27,625
but leaves all the other
neurological functions

375
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,478
perfectly intact.

376
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:32,650
In other words, you can't move...

377
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:35,989
but you feel everything.

378
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:40,956
It does absolutely nothing
to blunt the pain.

379
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,627
And you're about to
experience more of that

380
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:45,943
than you could ever
fucking imagine.

381
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:56,267
These are tourniquets

382
00:22:56,438 --> 00:23:00,096
so you don't bleed out,
'cause you may be here a while.

383
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,130
Saline solution-

384
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,586
that should keep us going.

385
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:08,422
Clamps- nice and secure.

386
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:12,081
Comfortable?

387
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:14,594
You really are shaking.

388
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:16,790
Sure you're all right?

389
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:20,791
You'll love this-

390
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,815
adrenaline.

391
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,658
Now this is so you
don't pass out.

392
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:30,067
There you go.

393
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:33,080
how's that feel? Good?

394
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:37,270
Now what we don't want
is you swallowing your tongue,

395
00:23:37,431 --> 00:23:39,311
so bear with me.

396
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:48,251
Now this is for your penis,
but we'll get to that later.

397
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:52,662
Scalpel...

398
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,576
for your eyelids,

399
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:57,310
in case you insist
on fucking shutting them.

400
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,116
You see,

401
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,579
I know what it feels like
to be helpless.

402
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:07,809
just like when I watched you
slaughter my whole family.

403
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:13,536
You know you can't
fight fate, right, Darby?

404
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,471
Oh!

405
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:20,619
And look-
l made this especially for you.

406
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:26,295
You like it? Yeah,
l didn't want you to miss anything.

407
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:31,426
Now you have the best
view in the house.

408
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,285
You hear that?

409
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:36,334
Your heart is beating so fast.

410
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:40,050
No, me too.

411
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:41,522
Okay.

412
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,024
Now they get to
watch you suffer.

413
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,878
They'll be the last thing
you ever see

414
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:55,009
as I cut off every single one
of your fucking limbs.

415
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:58,136
See, I wasn't lying

416
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:01,653
when I told you that I wanted
to keep you out of prison.

417
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:06,225
That was the truth.

418
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:40,857
Thanks for the car.

419
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:06,396
Sarah: Okay, these are all
the case files on Darby.

420
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:08,951
I vetted through what I could.
We have crime-scene photos-

421
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:10,732
Don't need to see 'em.

422
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:13,192
Okay.

423
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:20,853
- What's bothering you?
- It's Darby.

424
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:23,573
All the crimes he's committed
have one thing in common,

425
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:25,680
and that was violence.
But yesterday at that execution,

426
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:27,646
- that wasn't violence. That was-
- What?

427
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:29,841
- That was intellect.
- Okay.

428
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:32,862
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

429
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:36,343
I'm just thinking maybe
we shouldn't be looking for Darby.

430
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:47,823
Jesus Christ.

431
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:00,744
Rice.

432
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,534
Detective:
Good news, Counselor. We found Darby.

433
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:06,468
I gotta say though,
he's looked better.

434
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:10,012
Sarah:
They found him in about 25 pieces:

435
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:13,287
no legs, no arms,
eyelids were sliced off- gruesome.

436
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,085
- Nick: Shedding tears for Darby?
- Not quite.

437
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,983
- Cantrell: I see your wheels turning.
- Nick: Think motive- who has one?

438
00:27:18,143 --> 00:27:20,538
Cantrell: The husband, the father.
What do we know about him?

439
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,257
he owned the warehouse
where they found Darby.

440
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,600
- What else?
- he's a tinkerer-

441
00:27:23,795 --> 00:27:27,155
uh, little inventions, gizmos.
he holds two dozen patents

442
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:28,734
that made him some money.

443
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,468
he liquidated most of
his wealth a few years ago

444
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:34,870
to buy some industrial
properties around airports,

445
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,735
chemical plants,
rail yards.

446
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,147
- It doesn't add up.
- No, it's weird, right?

447
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:40,603
Search 'em all, Sarah.
See what you find.

448
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,127
Freeze!

449
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:55,059
- Get down, go!
- On your knees!

450
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:58,474
- Face down, face down!
- Pull him down and cuff him!

451
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,021
Crazy men scare
the shit out of me.

452
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:36,077
Detective:
ls this guy a lawyer?

453
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:37,553
No.

454
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,978
he's an engineer.

455
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:43,890
Sarah:
Nick, look at this.

456
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:20,124
Cantrell: We have zero evidence.
Gonna need a confession.

457
00:30:20,313 --> 00:30:21,865
he give you any trouble
on the way in?

458
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:23,114
No, nothing.

459
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,746
he wasn't too happy when
we took his bracelet, though.

460
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,117
- Can I help you?
- Package for the Rice family.

461
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,898
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

462
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,769
Mom, the video from my recital came.
Can we watch it?

463
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:46,208
- Please?
- No, not you.

464
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:48,687
No, please, we said we were
gonna wait for your father, remember?

465
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:50,722
- Please?
- No, not now.

466
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:52,757
Okay.

467
00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:55,966
Uh-huh, yes.

468
00:30:57,651 --> 00:30:59,593
Yes, absolutely.

469
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,650
Mommy!

470
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:36,007
Don't worry, he's just disarming
the guy, letting him feel easy.

471
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,977
What I'm about to tell you
l don't want anybody else to hear.

472
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:42,607
As a prosecutor, I'm breaking
all the rules right now,

473
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:45,213
and I don't give a damn
because I'm a father.

474
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:47,093
I have a little girl.

475
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,633
And what you did... bravo.

476
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:56,212
The world is better
without Darby and Ames.

477
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,438
You're not gonna see a tear shed
from me or anybody in my office.

478
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,087
With that being said...

479
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,252
I have a job to do.

480
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:13,430
I'm gonna ask you some very simple
and direct questions.

481
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:17,093
I suggest that you
answer them in the same fashion.

482
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:19,061
ls your name Clyde Alexander Shelton?

483
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:20,920
Yes, sir.

484
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,658
And you've waived
your right to counsel, correct?

485
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,230
- Yes, sir.
- You sure you want to do that?

486
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:27,488
Yes.

487
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:30,724
Did you murder Clarence Darby?

488
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:34,296
I wanted him dead.

489
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,940
he killed my wife and child.

490
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:39,016
Rupert Ames-
did you murder him as well?

491
00:32:40,547 --> 00:32:42,222
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

492
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,035
They both deserved to die.

493
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:48,425
So you arranged
both of those murders?

494
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,689
Yes, I planned it...

495
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:54,323
in my head, over and over again.
It took me a long time.

496
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,824
All right.

497
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,951
I guess we're done here.

498
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:03,428
Counselor?

499
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,337
You might want to cancel
your 12:30 lunch with Judge Roberts.

500
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:10,686
Excuse me?

501
00:33:10,877 --> 00:33:12,974
In fact, you might want to
cancel the rest of the week,

502
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,564
'cause you're gonna be busy.
Sit down.

503
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:19,516
We're done here.
We have your confession.

504
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:21,791
Mmm. Oh, you do?

505
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:23,352
On tape.

506
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:26,085
See, in our profession,
we consider that a slam-dunk.

507
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,706
Oh, really?
l don't think so. Let's think back.

508
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,346
What did I say?

509
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:33,248
That I wanted to kill
Clarence Darby?

510
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,505
Yeah, sure.
What father wouldn't?

511
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,001
That both Darby and Ames
deserved to die?

512
00:33:38,194 --> 00:33:39,622
I think most people
would agree with that.

513
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:42,721
That I planned it over and over
again in my head?

514
00:33:42,903 --> 00:33:45,811
Yeah. Who wouldn't
fantasize about that?

515
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:48,419
None of these are
an admission of guilt, Nick.

516
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:51,018
- You might want to check the tape.
- We know you did it.

517
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:54,193
Well, it's not what you know,
it's what you can prove in court.

518
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:55,642
Didn't you tell me that once?

519
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,018
The only problem with your theory

520
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:59,064
is that Darby's body was
found on your property.

521
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:02,102
One of my many properties-
an old abandoned warehouse, Nick.

522
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,879
Junkies, they trespass there
all the time.

523
00:34:05,057 --> 00:34:06,907
Isn't Darby involved
in the drug trade?

524
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:09,517
That's an unsavory world.
l bet you a jury would agree.

525
00:34:09,692 --> 00:34:12,415
Or perhaps someone was
trying to frame me.

526
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,114
You know, Clyde,

527
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:17,043
there's a lot of assholes in prison
that thought they were smarter than me.

528
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:19,498
Let's stop fucking around.

529
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:22,318
Nick, unless you have any
hard evidence,

530
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:24,629
then why are we even here?
Why are we having this-

531
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,958
- What do you want?
- -conversation?

532
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:30,832
Well, that's easy.

533
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:33,956
Now you're the one who
makes deals with murderers, yeah?

534
00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:36,117
So I've come to make mine.

535
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:40,340
I will give you a confession,
a real confession.

536
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,454
You just have to
give me something in return.

537
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:45,468
Yeah, well, since you
are a murderer, what might that be?

538
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,581
A bed.

539
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:52,048
But a nice bed.

540
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:54,388
I want a nice new one
for my cell.

541
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:55,881
Very simple.

542
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:58,343
You're gonna have to deal with that,
because the one I have is lumpy, Nick.

543
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:00,340
It's making me crazy.

544
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,820
Clyde, I think you've got me
confused with detail people.

545
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:04,855
See, I don't deal
with prison conditions.

546
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,043
I believe those cots
are bolted into the cells.

547
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:09,979
Well, that's what wrenches are for,
dumbass.

548
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:13,078
You know, one of those new
Duxiana beds

549
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:16,254
with the adjustable- you know,
adjustable lumbar support,

550
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:17,579
- that's the one.
- I've seen the commercial.

551
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:19,028
- That's the one I want.
- Those are nice.

552
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:20,820
- 'Cause really-
- Comes on late at night.

553
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:22,474
- And frankly I don't think-
- Two old people laying on the bed.

554
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:23,926
- I'll be able to focus
on anything

555
00:35:24,104 --> 00:35:26,046
until I've had a good
revitalizing night's sleep

556
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:28,218
in my therapeutic Duxiana bed.

557
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,920
So that's the deal:

558
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:33,270
you get me my bed,
you get your confession.

559
00:35:33,448 --> 00:35:35,997
Okay, let me think
about that for a second.

560
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:38,042
how about...

561
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:39,816
fuck no.

562
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:50,667
hey, what are you doing?

563
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:52,736
- What do you mean?
- Why did you tell him no?

564
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:55,712
A mattress? he doesn't make
those kinds of decisions.

565
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,750
Take your ego out of it, Nick. Shelton's
got a point: this case is shit.

566
00:35:58,918 --> 00:36:01,015
We need a confession.
And a mattress for a murder confession?

567
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:03,151
- That's a pretty good deal.
- he's playing us, Jonas.

568
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:04,662
Well, then we will play him.

569
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,231
Nick?

570
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,687
There's an urgent call from your office.
They say you're not answering your cell.

571
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:11,414
I need to finish up here and then
l will be home as soon as I can.

572
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:13,283
Listen to me:
the things on this video-

573
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:15,794
Nick, I have never seen
anything like it.

574
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:17,177
Please come home.

575
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,795
Listen, you need to calm down.
Tell her that it's not real...

576
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,418
- Okay.
- ... and that I love her.

577
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:23,531
Come home.
Come home soon, please.

578
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,323
- Kelly, did you see his face?
- No.

579
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,368
It was covered with something.
l couldn't see.

580
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:30,256
Okay, baby, let me finish up here and
I'll come home as fast as I can, okay?

581
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,091
Okay.

582
00:36:32,262 --> 00:36:35,016
This motherfucker sent a DVD to my house
of him killing Darby.

583
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:37,688
- What?
- My daughter saw it.

584
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:43,984
No no, he had on a mask.
We need that confession.

585
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,049
You still want to bargain
with this man?

586
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:49,704
Make the deal.

587
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,807
Man:
hey, come on, man! Give us one!

588
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,204
Back problems, Warden-
the worst.

589
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:11,532
You got bigger problems than that.

590
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,012
It's the have-nots in here, son.

591
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:17,496
I don't know that I want
to be the one ''have. ''

592
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,247
Turn around.

593
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:27,346
I don't think he likes me.

594
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:31,296
Nice bed.

595
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:34,779
Thank you.

596
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:37,197
It's a single.

597
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:41,451
I'd watch my fucking back
around here, you hear?

598
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:43,979
In the cell, let's go.

599
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,114
We can't put
Clyde Shelton anywhere-

600
00:37:49,312 --> 00:37:51,162
not in a job, not in a city,
not even the country.

601
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:54,070
So I dug a little deeper and I found
something from his missing years:

602
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:57,393
a couple of contract payments to Clyde
from the Department of Defense.

603
00:37:57,563 --> 00:37:59,958
- And his real estate?
- he bought nine properties

604
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,831
under his own name,
then he transferred them

605
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,048
to some corporation in Panama.

606
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:04,890
We can't get to the addresses.

607
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:06,315
A lack of reciprocity
is our problem.

608
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,891
So I'm gonna circle
back to the farmhouse.

609
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:10,953
That's a waste of time. he wanted us
to find it and find him there.

610
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:13,100
It's the industrial stuff
that's curious.

611
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:15,515
All right, I don't care what you
have to do and who you have to piss off.

612
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,927
If we have to invade
Panama again, fine.

613
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:20,338
Clyde is hiding those properties
for a reason. Find him.

614
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,608
Got it.

615
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:34,991
- Baby, you leave it cracked?
- hmm? Yeah, I left it cracked.

616
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:37,591
- Night light?
- Isn't she too old for a night light?

617
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,769
Yeah, I left a night light.

618
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,625
- Good.
- Look,

619
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:43,410
I told her that
that video wasn't real.

620
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,609
- Okay.
- It's some sort of horror film-

621
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,106
something she shouldn't
be looking at anyway.

622
00:38:47,297 --> 00:38:48,818
- Okay, good.
- She'll be okay.

623
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,308
Yeah. And you?

624
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,110
- Am I what? Okay?
- Yeah.

625
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:55,107
Of course.
Don't I look okay?

626
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:56,960
- hmm?
- Yeah.

627
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,060
Nick is always okay.

628
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,570
Always- I'm extra good.

629
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,855
I love you.

630
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,294
I love you too.

631
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:15,837
In light of Mr. Shelton's
economic means

632
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:17,528
and his potential flight risk,

633
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:20,766
the egregious nature of both
Mr. Ames's and Mr. Darby's deaths,

634
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:24,396
the state requests that
bail be denied, Your honor.

635
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:27,383
Judge:
Seeing as how you've...

636
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,277
waived your right to
counsel, Mr. Shelton,

637
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:32,441
do you have anything to say?

638
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:34,422
Mr. Shelton?

639
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,477
Do you have anything
that you'd like to say, Mr. Shelton?

640
00:39:38,652 --> 00:39:40,749
Yes yes yes, Your honor.

641
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,491
- Should I stand?
- Please.

642
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,551
Your honor, I'm a law-abiding citizen.

643
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:55,397
I'm just a regular guy.

644
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:58,056
I am not a flight risk.

645
00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:00,546
And this is my first alleged offense.

646
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,873
And the prosecution has not presented
one single piece of evidence against me.

647
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,088
Now in these circumstances,

648
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:10,506
unless the state has obtained
some new piece of information

649
00:40:10,677 --> 00:40:13,134
relating to my involvement
in the matter in question,

650
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:16,829
then I find it highly prejudicial,
even constitutionally offensive,

651
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:19,042
to keep me detained without bail.

652
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:21,080
It's a slippery slope,
Your honor.

653
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:24,050
haven't we seen the result
of such violations,

654
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:26,399
both internationally and domestically?
Case in point

655
00:40:26,577 --> 00:40:30,421
would be Day v. McDonough,
docket #041325.

656
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:36,538
I am actually inclined
to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.

657
00:40:37,692 --> 00:40:40,446
Your honor, Mr. Shelton has
agreed to give us a full confession.

658
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:43,281
has he given it, Mr. Rice?

659
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:44,741
No, Your honor.

660
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:47,321
Well, then in my opinion,

661
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:49,944
the state has failed to establish
a compelling basis

662
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,971
for its motion,
and I will grant bail in the amount of-

663
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:55,082
Your honor,
l would caution you not to do that.

664
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,644
Thank you.

665
00:40:57,812 --> 00:40:59,178
Excuse me?

666
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,689
No, I don't think I will excuse you.

667
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,555
You see, this is what
I'm talking about.

668
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,336
You were about to let me go.
Are you kidding me?

669
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:09,577
This is why we're here
in the first place.

670
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:13,132
You think I don't remember
who you are, lady?

671
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:15,845
I would tread carefully, Mr. Shelton.

672
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,530
Well, how carefully
should I tread?

673
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:20,131
Because apparently
l just killed two people,

674
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:23,398
and you were about to let me
walk right out that door!

675
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,710
how misguided are you?

676
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,881
I feed you a couple of
bullshit legal precedents,

677
00:41:29,046 --> 00:41:31,800
and there you go- you jump
on it like a bitch in heat.

678
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:34,173
- Folks, you all hang out-
- I'm warning you, Mr. Shelton!

679
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,064
- -in the same little club.
- You will be held in contempt!

680
00:41:36,242 --> 00:41:38,215
And every day you let madmen
and murderers back on the street.

681
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,548
- You're too busy treating the law-
- One more time!

682
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:41,948
- -like it's a fucking assembly line!
- One more time.

683
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,640
- Do you have any idea what justice is?
- You are now-

684
00:41:43,816 --> 00:41:45,521
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- -in contempt of court.

685
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:48,453
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- Remove this man.

686
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:50,826
- Whatever happened to the people?
- Bail denied!

687
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:52,748
- Whatever happened to justice?
- Bail denied!

688
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:55,810
And I bet you take it up
the fucking ass, bitch.

689
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:57,023
Bailiff.

690
00:41:57,191 --> 00:41:58,773
Clyde:
hey, see you later, Nick.

691
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:01,914
Nick:
Insanity?

692
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:05,466
That's what you're building
your defense on? Insanity?

693
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:09,833
Nick, I told you I would
give you a confession.

694
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:11,521
And l- I meant it.

695
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,279
My daughter saw the same movie.

696
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:19,023
Well, you taught your daughter
about good versus evil?

697
00:42:19,194 --> 00:42:20,653
I don't have to.

698
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:23,945
Well, that's what this movie was about:
good conquering evil,

699
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,227
the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

700
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,096
I didn't get that.

701
00:42:28,274 --> 00:42:30,977
I'm gonna give you
one more chance, Clyde.

702
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:34,282
And don't test me
'cause I will run you over.

703
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:36,159
Fair enough.

704
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:38,608
You did get me my bed.

705
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:40,821
A deal's a deal.

706
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:43,435
That was you on video
killing Clarence Darby, wasn't it?

707
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:45,161
Yes, that was me.

708
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:50,401
Okay, fair enough.
That was me, Clyde Shelton,

709
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:52,254
on the video,
killing Clarence Darby.

710
00:42:52,426 --> 00:42:54,276
Not good enough, Clyde.
l need specifics.

711
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,701
I took his fingers with bolt cutters,

712
00:42:59,886 --> 00:43:00,954
his toes with tin snips,

713
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:03,225
his balls with a hacksaw,

714
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,329
and his penis with a box cutter.

715
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:08,037
how's that for specifics?

716
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,263
And Ames?

717
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:13,673
Switching the canisters was easy.
Everything's automated these days,

718
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:15,868
so I just hacked into
the shipping company's server

719
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:18,659
and swapped a few numbers around
so the package came to me.

720
00:43:18,837 --> 00:43:20,810
Then I switched
the potassium chloride

721
00:43:20,984 --> 00:43:24,828
with something a little more...
deliberate.

722
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,900
Well, I'm tired of
hearing your bullshit.

723
00:43:28,068 --> 00:43:29,774
I got everything I need.

724
00:43:30,705 --> 00:43:31,897
What now?

725
00:43:32,062 --> 00:43:33,614
I go home;
you go to prison.

726
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:35,953
You know, the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

727
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:38,135
That ought to make you
feel better about the system.

728
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:39,446
What if I had another
confession to make?

729
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:41,155
Call a priest.

730
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:43,005
But another confession would
mean another deal, Nick,

731
00:43:43,177 --> 00:43:45,901
so you would have to
give me something in return.

732
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:52,435
You ever been to Del Frisco's?
They cater.

733
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:56,049
So for lunch, I would love
a 20oz porterhouse steak,

734
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:58,402
medium,
maybe a little bit charred,

735
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:02,430
with all the trimmings-
pommes frites, asparagus, butter squash.

736
00:44:02,618 --> 00:44:04,889
Fuck you and your pommes frites.

737
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:08,664
I'll tell you what:
can I have my iPod as well?

738
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:11,383
I'd love a little bit
of music with my meal.

739
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,127
First rule of negotiating, Clyde: you
gotta have something to bargain with.

740
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:17,443
Would the life of
Bill Reynolds suffice?

741
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:25,132
Open it.

742
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,208
Who the fuck is Bill Reynolds?

743
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:30,828
Darby's attorney.

744
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:33,185
Tell me you located him.

745
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:36,569
I've got his wife.
She reported him missing three days ago.

746
00:44:36,754 --> 00:44:38,429
Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds.

747
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,324
Clyde: Well, looks like I got something
to bargain with after all, Nick.

748
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:45,077
At the moment,
Bill Reynolds is still alive.

749
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:47,848
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

750
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,472
Just bring me my meal and
my music at 1 :00 exactly.

751
00:44:51,636 --> 00:44:53,795
00 sharp.

752
00:44:53,973 --> 00:44:55,853
00, Nick.

753
00:45:08,403 --> 00:45:10,221
That's good, right there.

754
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,373
All right, up!

755
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,306
- It's 5 to 1 :00.
- I don't take orders from him or you.

756
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,165
And inmates don't have
access to the time.

757
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:28,947
- We tell them what time it is.
- I don't care if he has a Rolex or not.

758
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,943
We need to stick to the timeline
that was agreed to.

759
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:33,003
Fuck him, Nick.
Let him wait.

760
00:45:33,194 --> 00:45:34,715
Christ, he sawed a guy's dick off.

761
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,832
Whether you like it or not,
we are on his time.

762
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,583
Check it again.

763
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:44,025
Inmate:
Are you shitting me with this?!

764
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:47,699
This motherfucker!

765
00:45:51,671 --> 00:45:53,846
Man, come on!
I'm fucking hungry!

766
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:00,694
Steamed asparagus,

767
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,267
- lobster macaroni and cheese...
- Wow.

768
00:46:04,597 --> 00:46:07,287
...porterhouse steak,
seared, medium rare.

769
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:09,943
Mmm!

770
00:46:13,785 --> 00:46:15,193
hmm.

771
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:17,100
- Napkin, Nick.
- Napkin.

772
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,642
Oh, excuse me, waiter?

773
00:46:21,798 --> 00:46:24,372
You might want to put 30%
down for yourself, my man.

774
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:29,470
- hey, what time is it?
- It's 1 :00.

775
00:46:30,593 --> 00:46:31,885
ls that right, Nick?

776
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:35,200
- It's 1 :08.
- That's disappointing, Warden.

777
00:46:35,364 --> 00:46:37,229
I mean, how can you expect me
not to fuck with you

778
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:38,686
when you can't even
be honest with me?

779
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:42,148
Late or not, Clyde, you have what you
asked for. Now where's Reynolds?

780
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:43,921
Can I have some silverware,
gentlemen?

781
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:45,274
Silverware.

782
00:46:45,442 --> 00:46:47,365
You get a spork.

783
00:46:48,256 --> 00:46:49,974
Idiot.

784
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:53,402
Thanks.

785
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:02,680
Come on, Clyde.

786
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:07,945
Okay.

787
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:10,447
here we go:

788
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,251
39N57'...

789
00:47:13,432 --> 00:47:14,753
04'',

790
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:18,045
075W10'22''.

791
00:47:18,204 --> 00:47:19,554
And you'd better hurry, Nick.

792
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:21,881
'Cause by anybody's watch but
the warden's, you're already late.

793
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,342
- Open the door!
- Inmate: Where's my lunch?

794
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,991
I'll take a ground unit!

795
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:53,147
So I suppose if I don't
share this with you, you're gonna-

796
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:54,529
I'm gonna get the fuck up,

797
00:47:54,704 --> 00:47:56,404
I'm gonna cock back
my right hand,

798
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:59,586
and I'm gonna split your whole
fucking skull in two. how about that?

799
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:03,714
Well, come on over here. Join me.
There's plenty to go around.

800
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:10,529
here, enjoy.
have some pasta.

801
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:12,471
It's good.

802
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:14,002
What about some steak?
You want steak?

803
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,446
- Mmm.
- here, have some steak.

804
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:17,385
here's a big piece for you.

805
00:48:17,566 --> 00:48:19,343
There you go.

806
00:48:22,552 --> 00:48:23,766
Good, huh?

807
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:34,103
What'd you do
to get in here, anyways?

808
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:37,934
I did what I had to do.

809
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,287
So you got a girl or something?

810
00:48:46,446 --> 00:48:48,883
Mmm, it's a long story.

811
00:48:52,322 --> 00:48:53,905
Pilot, how much longer?

812
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:56,669
Two minutes.

813
00:48:59,123 --> 00:49:01,163
how about you?
You have a girl?

814
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:03,448
- Got a few girls back home.
- Oh, yeah?

815
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,017
Yeah.

816
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:07,731
- You have a boyfriend in here or no?
- Get the fuck out of here.

817
00:49:19,884 --> 00:49:21,409
This is- it's Reynolds'.

818
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:24,422
- Not a good sign, Nick.
- Just dig.

819
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:37,932
- Jesus Christ!
- Reynolds!

820
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:40,691
- he's unconscious.
- Reynolds!

821
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:43,412
he's gone, Nick.
he's gone.

822
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,283
- Oxygen?
- Get something to get him out!

823
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:48,424
Detective: he's got IV lines
going to his-

824
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:50,363
he's got him cuffed!

825
00:49:50,544 --> 00:49:53,468
Nick: Listen, you got your keys
to the cuffs?

826
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,854
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

827
00:49:57,025 --> 00:49:58,462
Shit.

828
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,891
Oh, God, I'm so happy.

829
00:50:01,049 --> 00:50:03,167
Your lucky day, huh?
Get some food.

830
00:50:03,328 --> 00:50:05,766
here, wanna take a shot at this?

831
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:07,705
- What is it?
- Know how to use it?

832
00:50:07,886 --> 00:50:09,780
No.

833
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:26,562
Inmate:
Oh, shit! Check this out!

834
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:31,110
he's crazy!

835
00:50:31,282 --> 00:50:32,545
Don't stop now, partner!

836
00:50:32,707 --> 00:50:35,115
Finish him, come on!
Take his head off!

837
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:38,875
Take it off!

838
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,374
I need a shower, Warden.

839
00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:07,546
Get him out of there!

840
00:51:10,596 --> 00:51:12,664
Nick: Dunnigan,
what time do you have?

841
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:15,688
37.

842
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:17,362
Took us roughly 15 minutes
to get here.

843
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:18,432
Yeah?

844
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,726
Reynolds' air was rigged to
shut off at 1 :15.

845
00:51:20,887 --> 00:51:23,209
If Shelton would have got
his lunch on time, he'd still be alive.

846
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:24,447
Fuck this guy, Nick.

847
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:27,802
he wants to play games,
we can play games too.

848
00:51:27,974 --> 00:51:29,955
We need to take the gloves off.

849
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,547
No.

850
00:51:35,096 --> 00:51:37,670
Nick, it's Sarah.
Listen, Clyde murdered his cell-mate.

851
00:51:37,837 --> 00:51:41,130
The warden is furious.
he's moving him to solitary.

852
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:43,186
That's all I know right now.

853
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:11,975
how are we doing?

854
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,597
Great. Can you believe this?

855
00:52:14,766 --> 00:52:17,398
Checking his iPod for clues.

856
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:18,871
I do the same thing
with my daughter's.

857
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:20,476
Learn anything?

858
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,680
Yeah, they both got
shit taste in music.

859
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:26,462
We got a game plan
with this guy or what?

860
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:27,944
Game plan?

861
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,702
I tell you, I got a game plan.

862
00:52:29,864 --> 00:52:32,156
Give me five minutes alone with him
and I'll cripple the fucker.

863
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:34,876
I don't give a shit
what happened to his family.

864
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:36,242
It's no excuse.

865
00:52:42,328 --> 00:52:43,648
Wow.

866
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,149
Stop right there.

867
00:52:58,602 --> 00:53:00,039
Step into the cell.

868
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:41,586
We found Reynolds.

869
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:44,257
Moments too late,
from what I hear.

870
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:47,608
I had to call his wife and tell her
that her husband had been buried alive.

871
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:50,188
Justice should be harsh, Nick,

872
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:52,461
but especially for those
who denied it to others.

873
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:54,797
And your cell-mate?
What was that about?

874
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,385
You murdered a man
because your lunch was late.

875
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:02,088
No.

876
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,876
No. No, you murdered him
because you couldn't keep your word.

877
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:08,650
We made a deal, you and l:
00 PM.

878
00:54:08,824 --> 00:54:11,262
That's a pretty important principle
I'd like you start learning, Nick:

879
00:54:11,424 --> 00:54:13,036
- keeping your word.
- Oh, really?

880
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:15,672
What principle was at work when
you tortured and killed those people?

881
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,133
That everyone must be held
accountable for their actions.

882
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,708
You think your wife
and daughter would feel good

883
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:29,288
about you killing in their name?

884
00:54:51,272 --> 00:54:54,273
My wife and daughter
can't feel anything.

885
00:54:55,474 --> 00:54:57,174
They're dead.

886
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:29,520
hey, Nick?

887
00:55:29,695 --> 00:55:31,677
On Clyde's real estate,
Judge Stansfield shut us down.

888
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:34,756
he's looking for some sort of legal
precedent that I'm not sure exists.

889
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:35,794
- But?
- But...

890
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:37,031
I think I may have found
a way around it.

891
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,044
- I'll call in a favor from a friend.
- Who's your friend?

892
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:41,039
You don't name your friends
or they stop doing you favors.

893
00:55:41,198 --> 00:55:42,576
Something else Cantrell said.

894
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:46,173
No, that was all you.
Jonas, hi.

895
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:49,677
She's thinking just like you, Nick.
Guess you trained her well.

896
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:52,405
- One day she'll have my job.
- Let's get some air.

897
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:56,996
Clyde's government contract payments
were bothering me,

898
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:59,326
so I pulled some ancient strings.
We're meeting someone.

899
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:00,715
Who might that be?

900
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:04,153
Someone who does some really nasty shit
so we can live the American dream.

901
00:56:14,565 --> 00:56:16,206
So Clyde finally lost it?

902
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:18,158
Somebody must have
really pissed him off.

903
00:56:18,339 --> 00:56:20,321
You worked with Shelton,
is that right?

904
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:23,622
Okay, first of all,
l was never here and we never spoke.

905
00:56:23,787 --> 00:56:25,992
Tell us what we're dealing with.
Shelton was a spy or-

906
00:56:26,173 --> 00:56:28,348
Spies are a dime a dozen.
I'm a spy.

907
00:56:28,523 --> 00:56:31,495
Clyde is a brain.
he's a think-tank type guy.

908
00:56:31,657 --> 00:56:33,775
his specialty was low-impact
kinetic operations.

909
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:35,947
ls this a hell of a fancy way
to say that he kills people?

910
00:56:36,108 --> 00:56:37,030
We kill people.

911
00:56:37,212 --> 00:56:39,330
he figured out how to do it
without ever being in the same room.

912
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:42,327
It was his gift,
and he was the best.

913
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:44,522
One time we're tasking
this tricky target.

914
00:56:44,691 --> 00:56:46,808
I mean, we're using cruise missiles
and predators

915
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:50,174
and we even had a B-2 bomber
flatten this guy's villa with a JDAM.

916
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:51,702
All right? We're burning up
millions in ordnance

917
00:56:51,884 --> 00:56:53,010
and we're getting nowhere
with this guy.

918
00:56:53,165 --> 00:56:55,632
So we call Clyde and
we ask him to solve our problem.

919
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:57,413
Clyde develops a Kevlar thread

920
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,844
with a high-tech ratchet
made of carbon fiber

921
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:01,585
put in a necktie.

922
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:03,923
Two days later, Mrs. Bad Guy
comes home,

923
00:57:04,098 --> 00:57:06,390
finds Mr. Bad Guy dead
on the bathroom tile,

924
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:07,652
choked to death.

925
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,663
What I'm saying is, just assume
that this guy can hear and see

926
00:57:11,826 --> 00:57:13,205
everything that you're doing.

927
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:15,170
Nick: No, we've got him locked away,
maximum security.

928
00:57:15,351 --> 00:57:17,906
Man: If he's in jail, it's because
he wants to be in jail.

929
00:57:18,057 --> 00:57:21,175
he's a born tactician. Every move
that he makes, it means something.

930
00:57:22,081 --> 00:57:24,150
That cell-mate that he killed-
you think that was random?

931
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:27,008
No.

932
00:57:27,173 --> 00:57:29,378
That's a pawn being
moved off the board.

933
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:33,178
If I were you,
I'd be looking for the next piece.

934
00:57:33,334 --> 00:57:35,597
Anybody who had anything
to do with that case,

935
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,894
So what are you saying?
You saying we can't stop him?

936
00:57:43,696 --> 00:57:46,105
Walk into his cell
and put a bullet in his head.

937
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:50,217
Aside from that?
No, you can't stop him.

938
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:52,460
If Clyde wants you dead,
you're dead.

939
00:58:02,285 --> 00:58:04,839
- hello?
- Sarah? Sarah, it's Nick.

940
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:06,458
Set up a meeting
with Judge Burch.

941
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,330
We need her to help us
keep Clyde on ice.

942
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:10,685
help us with what, Nick?
The man's in prison.

943
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:12,304
he's worse than we thought.

944
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,538
- Chester's your boyfriend, right?
- Chester.

945
00:58:14,712 --> 00:58:16,266
Yeah.

946
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:19,141
Good. Maybe stay a few days
at his place.

947
00:58:19,307 --> 00:58:21,881
And have Dunnigan send
a patrol car to my house.

948
00:58:22,048 --> 00:58:23,515
Sorry about this, Sarah.

949
00:58:29,705 --> 00:58:31,599
Judge Burch:
l can't supersede the penal code.

950
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,984
You've already got him in solitary.

951
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:35,052
A half-decent paralegal will have him
out of there by next week.

952
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,632
We just want to limit his options;

953
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:38,170
give him less contact,
less access,

954
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:41,136
even if it's just rescinding his
mandatory exercise period for a week.

955
00:58:41,314 --> 00:58:43,092
- Under what cause?
- Whatever cause you want.

956
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,137
Wrap it around whatever
piece of legal doctrine

957
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:48,332
that helps you rationalize it,
Your honor.

958
00:58:49,895 --> 00:58:50,905
So let me get this straight:

959
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:53,335
you want me to violate
his God-given civil rights

960
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:55,901
in the name of some murky sense
of the greater good.

961
00:58:56,056 --> 00:58:57,834
ls that the gist of it, gentlemen?

962
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:05,710
Okay. I'm game.

963
00:59:06,596 --> 00:59:10,141
Just don't plan
on it sticking for long, all right?

964
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,586
Wait, you're gonna take that,

965
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:16,500
after all the grief you've
given me over cell phones?

966
00:59:16,675 --> 00:59:19,141
That's one of the benefits of
being a judge, Mr. Rice.

967
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:21,884
I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

968
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,137
hello?

969
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:28,779
Oh my God.

970
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,135
Nick:
Back out. Back out.

971
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:36,976
Female reporter:... at city hall, though
we are unable to confirm the details,

972
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,928
we do know that
at least one person is dead

973
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,886
in what officials are calling
a possible murder.

974
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:42,961
We have reporters
on the ground...

975
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:44,172
Up.

976
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:50,071
Somebody's helping this guy-

977
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:52,149
a bomb in that phone,
and she doesn't know about it.

978
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,817
Who had access?

979
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,428
Are you okay?

980
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:58,857
I've survived the war
and two ex-wives. I'll be fine.

981
01:00:00,582 --> 01:00:02,106
how are you holding up?

982
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:04,214
I'm good.

983
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,206
So you're killing judges now?

984
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:22,871
In my experience, Nick, lessons not
learned in blood are soon forgotten.

985
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,256
And vengeance keeps you
warm at night.

986
01:00:25,438 --> 01:00:27,138
Vengeance?

987
01:00:28,678 --> 01:00:31,145
That's what you think this is about?
Vengeance?

988
01:00:31,314 --> 01:00:32,693
What else could it be?

989
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:36,484
No, Nick, I had 10 years
for vengeance, if that's what I wanted.

990
01:00:36,655 --> 01:00:39,715
You don't think that I watch you
go to work every morning at 8:00 AM?

991
01:00:39,895 --> 01:00:43,217
Or that I watch Kelly take Denise
to school, 8:15?

992
01:00:43,386 --> 01:00:46,562
No, I could have slaughtered you
or your family anytime I wanted!

993
01:00:46,732 --> 01:00:49,025
You even think about
touching my family-

994
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,191
you even think about touching
my family...

995
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,261
I do my job.

996
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,450
I'm the best at it.

997
01:01:03,612 --> 01:01:05,506
- It works.
- You were doing your job

998
01:01:05,677 --> 01:01:09,310
the way that best served you, Nick-
the way that best served you.

999
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:12,236
- That has to change.
- What do you want, Clyde?

1000
01:01:12,408 --> 01:01:14,554
You at war with the whole world?
It's not gonna bring anybody back.

1001
01:01:14,722 --> 01:01:17,500
No, I'm at war with this-

1002
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:20,252
this- this broken thing-

1003
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,138
this thing that brought
you and I together.

1004
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:24,347
This broken thing works
for people that are sane.

1005
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,526
You think doing what you're doing
is gonna change anything?

1006
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,805
You and whoever else
you have helping you

1007
01:01:28,966 --> 01:01:30,666
are gonna pay.

1008
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,878
I don't think you
have any idea

1009
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:36,205
who's helping me
or what I'm doing.

1010
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:37,296
It's a matter of time.

1011
01:01:37,477 --> 01:01:39,371
See, you see the bodies,
you see the smoke,

1012
01:01:39,543 --> 01:01:42,117
but the larger picture
still eludes you.

1013
01:01:42,284 --> 01:01:44,033
Do tell.

1014
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:47,645
I would like to...

1015
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,329
but I would rather show you.

1016
01:01:51,152 --> 01:01:54,561
I still have faith in you,
so I'm gonna give you one last chance.

1017
01:01:54,713 --> 01:01:55,810
here's the deal:

1018
01:01:55,994 --> 01:01:59,743
release me and drop
all charges by 6:00 AM.

1019
01:01:59,912 --> 01:02:02,233
- 6:00 AM, Nick.
- Or what?

1020
01:02:04,577 --> 01:02:06,985
Or I kill everyone.

1021
01:02:16,684 --> 01:02:18,151
- hello?
- Nick: Yeah, Sarah,

1022
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:20,876
he has to have an accomplice-
probably somebody inside the prison.

1023
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,865
We have to go through all the prisoners'
files to find some sort of connection.

1024
01:02:24,019 --> 01:02:25,456
Do you want the files
brought to the office?

1025
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:28,341
No, there isn't time. Get everybody
together and bring them to the prison.

1026
01:02:28,507 --> 01:02:29,721
We're moving in.

1027
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:47,092
Stop looking at your watch.

1028
01:02:48,982 --> 01:02:50,419
Anything from your friend?

1029
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:51,935
This treaty with Panama is a mess.

1030
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:54,612
We can't access anything about
specific property holdings,

1031
01:02:54,786 --> 01:02:56,369
but my friend found
this tiny loophole

1032
01:02:56,532 --> 01:02:59,251
that grants us access to
Clyde's corporate expenses.

1033
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:00,660
Does that help?

1034
01:03:04,402 --> 01:03:07,724
So we match sale prices
of industrial properties sold in Philly

1035
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:10,184
up against purchases made
by his corporation.

1036
01:03:10,348 --> 01:03:13,185
Okay, I got it.

1037
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,214
- hey, Nick, can I ask you something?
- hmm?

1038
01:03:25,732 --> 01:03:27,597
Would you do it
the same way now?

1039
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,879
Would you still cut
a deal for Darby?

1040
01:03:31,465 --> 01:03:34,758
This is the job, Sarah.
We have to make choices.

1041
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,183
- But did you make the right choice?
- We made the right choice, right?

1042
01:03:40,368 --> 01:03:42,290
I don't know.

1043
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:44,509
I'm 35, Nick.

1044
01:03:44,677 --> 01:03:46,318
And there are things-
there are possibilities

1045
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:47,960
that I'm not gonna have now.

1046
01:03:48,986 --> 01:03:52,308
And it's okay.
l know it's part of the deal.

1047
01:03:53,899 --> 01:03:56,590
And don't get me wrong.
l love working for you.

1048
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:02,556
But I just want to make sure
l gave up those things

1049
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:05,625
for more than just
a high conviction rate.

1050
01:04:22,637 --> 01:04:24,133
Do you want any more coffee?

1051
01:04:24,311 --> 01:04:25,350
No.

1052
01:05:13,132 --> 01:05:15,026
All right.

1053
01:05:15,197 --> 01:05:17,179
All right, let's just get focused here.
This guy's not God.

1054
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,374
he's not the All Powerful.
he's just well-prepared.

1055
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:21,242
We need to be equally
well-prepared.

1056
01:05:21,394 --> 01:05:24,541
Take a couple of hours, go home,
come back. We'll get a fresh start.

1057
01:05:24,706 --> 01:05:25,861
Okay?

1058
01:05:34,427 --> 01:05:37,690
Man: Come on, old man, let's see if
we can find you some breakfast.

1059
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,274
hey, Nick, get some rest.

1060
01:05:52,446 --> 01:05:56,137
Give Chester my regards.
When do I get to meet him?

1061
01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:59,040
Oh, he's not ready for that.

1062
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:01,429
'Night, Jonas.

1063
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:13,035
I don't know how
this one's gonna turn out, Nick.

1064
01:06:13,206 --> 01:06:14,906
We're gonna stop him.
That's how it's gonna turn out.

1065
01:06:16,341 --> 01:06:25,209
Ahh!

1066
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:27,678
Sarah.

1067
01:06:32,507 --> 01:06:33,721
Sarah.

1068
01:07:02,277 --> 01:07:05,278
Reporter: In the past 48 hours, six
officials from the Justice Department

1069
01:07:05,446 --> 01:07:08,225
have been killed in a series of vicious
and premeditated attacks.

1070
01:07:08,402 --> 01:07:10,666
This marks the first time in
the history of the United States

1071
01:07:10,824 --> 01:07:13,261
where government officials have been,
by all appearances,

1072
01:07:13,423 --> 01:07:15,064
systematically murdered.

1073
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,648
We'll continue to follow this story and
bring you up-to-the-minute details...

1074
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,634
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this now,
but we've got something here.

1075
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:26,078
Found this right outside the wall-

1076
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:27,739
radio beacon-

1077
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:30,209
sent an arming signal to the car bombs
when they went through the gate.

1078
01:07:30,374 --> 01:07:32,549
Dunnigan: Security said they checked
every car before anybody got in them.

1079
01:07:32,724 --> 01:07:35,502
They didn't check the gas tanks.
That's where the clever prick put 'em.

1080
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,117
Real precise stuff too.

1081
01:07:37,283 --> 01:07:38,895
Could have taken out
a lot more if he wanted to.

1082
01:07:39,063 --> 01:07:41,413
- Cantrell: What about Nick's car?
- That's the weird thing.

1083
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:46,568
I gotta go.

1084
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,732
Woman:
Jesus Christ.

1085
01:08:02,031 --> 01:08:03,867
Privacy, please.

1086
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,988
So let me get this straight:

1087
01:08:08,157 --> 01:08:10,623
not only do we
know who did it,

1088
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:14,249
we have him locked up
and he's still killing people?

1089
01:08:15,456 --> 01:08:19,001
You boys sure
fucked this one up.

1090
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:22,618
The press is gonna kill us.

1091
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:24,142
Can someone explain this to me?

1092
01:08:24,323 --> 01:08:25,760
We can't yet.

1093
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:33,087
how did this get away
from you, Jonas?

1094
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:35,126
It's complicated, April.

1095
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:37,331
he's very smart.
he's very angry.

1096
01:08:37,499 --> 01:08:39,703
We assume he has an accomplice
helping him on the outside.

1097
01:08:39,885 --> 01:08:42,945
I'm not having
this conversation.

1098
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:46,126
I don't care how smart he is
or who's helping him.

1099
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,020
We'll release a statement saying we
have suspects, we're following leads-

1100
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:56,638
- nothing alarming.
- Mayor, you have my word,

1101
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,257
we are gonna stop this guy.
he's not gonna hurt anybody else.

1102
01:09:04,278 --> 01:09:06,570
I'm assigning security to
each of you from now on.

1103
01:09:10,296 --> 01:09:12,365
Get this situation
under control, gentlemen.

1104
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:28,114
Dad?

1105
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,261
I bet you don't remember
when I did that.

1106
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,456
I bet you I do.

1107
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:46,797
What?

1108
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,411
Nothing.

1109
01:09:48,577 --> 01:09:51,355
You and your mother are going away
on a little vacation, that's all.

1110
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:52,853
- You like vacations, right?
- Yeah.

1111
01:09:53,028 --> 01:09:54,611
Good.

1112
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,211
But why?

1113
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:58,211
Why not now?

1114
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,205
Okay.

1115
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:02,773
Don't need an excuse, right?

1116
01:10:05,812 --> 01:10:06,880
All right.

1117
01:10:07,059 --> 01:10:10,410
No phone calls, no credit cards,
no computers- just cash.

1118
01:10:10,584 --> 01:10:11,905
Daddy, are you coming?

1119
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,518
Oh, yeah, of course.

1120
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,661
- Of course I am.
- You'd better, Nick.

1121
01:10:21,481 --> 01:10:23,006
It was first grade, hmm?

1122
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,026
Your mother helped you
with the spelling.

1123
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:27,020
It was my birthday.

1124
01:10:27,178 --> 01:10:29,529
- Man: We need to go!
- Let's go.

1125
01:10:29,706 --> 01:10:31,114
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

1126
01:10:31,274 --> 01:10:33,256
- Love you, Daddy.
- Love you too.

1127
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,581
- Nick, your phone lines are clear.
- Good.

1128
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:42,323
No bugs; nothing's been tampered with.
You're good.

1129
01:12:14,793 --> 01:12:16,628
You should have taken my deal.

1130
01:12:20,312 --> 01:12:24,285
That's six fucking innocent people.
ls that how you want to play it? huh?

1131
01:12:24,443 --> 01:12:26,910
It's okay.
It's okay, Nick. I know you're angry.

1132
01:12:27,078 --> 01:12:29,399
That's good. That's what it takes.
That's how it has to be.

1133
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:30,950
What if I said you was right
and I was wrong?

1134
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,488
What if I had said, ''Well,
let's take them to trial''? huh?

1135
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:35,016
Then I would say
you're making progress.

1136
01:12:35,197 --> 01:12:37,917
And we might have lost!
And Ames and Darby would both go free.

1137
01:12:38,081 --> 01:12:40,150
Don't you get that?

1138
01:12:40,325 --> 01:12:41,364
Fuck.

1139
01:12:41,536 --> 01:12:43,401
You didn't care, Nick.
You didn't even try.

1140
01:12:43,565 --> 01:12:45,858
You could have walked out of
that courtroom with your head held high.

1141
01:12:46,023 --> 01:12:47,489
I could have lived with that, Nick.

1142
01:12:47,661 --> 01:12:49,157
I keep my head up.

1143
01:12:49,334 --> 01:12:52,540
And you will end this.

1144
01:12:54,106 --> 01:12:55,884
I'm just getting warmed up.

1145
01:12:56,065 --> 01:12:58,386
This is Von Clausewitz shit-
total fucking war.

1146
01:12:58,557 --> 01:13:00,169
You fuck.

1147
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:05,903
No.

1148
01:13:13,798 --> 01:13:16,372
I'm gonna pull
the whole thing down.

1149
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,037
I'm gonna bring the whole
fucking diseased, corrupt temple

1150
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:21,280
down on your head.

1151
01:13:21,455 --> 01:13:23,630
It's gonna be Biblical.

1152
01:13:38,512 --> 01:13:41,144
Cantrell:
Jesus, Nick, she was a good kid.

1153
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:44,048
Did we bring this all on ourselves?

1154
01:13:46,097 --> 01:13:48,079
Absolutely not.

1155
01:13:49,978 --> 01:13:52,096
You don't actually believe that,
do you?

1156
01:13:56,174 --> 01:13:58,321
Gentlemen? Sorry,
but we need to get going

1157
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:00,529
if we're going to make it
to the press conference.

1158
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,691
I want to read you something
from my speech before we go.

1159
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:15,110
''We must not give in
to the fear.

1160
01:14:15,262 --> 01:14:17,583
We must face
those things we fear the most.

1161
01:14:17,755 --> 01:14:19,736
We must appeal
to our better angels. ''

1162
01:14:19,891 --> 01:14:21,532
Too much?

1163
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,319
I'm sorry.

1164
01:14:23,488 --> 01:14:26,518
It's just before, when you asked
if we brought this on ourselves-

1165
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:28,441
we didn't.

1166
01:14:28,616 --> 01:14:29,937
I did.

1167
01:14:31,642 --> 01:14:35,217
When I was young,
l really wanted to change the system.

1168
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:39,354
You know, I was ready to fight.
l was gonna be the best no matter what.

1169
01:14:39,512 --> 01:14:41,377
You give an inch here,
you give an inch there,

1170
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:43,806
you get caught up
in the game.

1171
01:14:43,963 --> 01:14:46,936
And then you realize that the system
that you're trying to change-

1172
01:14:47,097 --> 01:14:49,214
it changed you.

1173
01:14:49,377 --> 01:14:50,988
Jonas, I've lost my way
somewhere.

1174
01:14:51,157 --> 01:14:53,274
Look, remember what I told you?

1175
01:14:53,435 --> 01:14:56,553
The hard part isn't
making the decision.

1176
01:14:56,712 --> 01:15:00,034
It's living with it.

1177
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:05,476
Man:
Everybody stay sharp.

1178
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:06,971
We're on the move.

1179
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,680
- We all right?
- Dunnigan: It's dead.

1180
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:19,357
Electrical system's fried.

1181
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,435
Man over radio:
What's going on back there?

1182
01:16:24,064 --> 01:16:25,899
Dunnigan, tell them to
get Jonas away from here.

1183
01:16:33,144 --> 01:16:35,009
What the fuck is that?

1184
01:16:37,062 --> 01:16:38,101
Get down, get down!

1185
01:16:58,855 --> 01:17:00,894
Jonas! Jonas!

1186
01:17:01,775 --> 01:17:03,124
- Jonas! Jonas!
- No, Nick! Get back!

1187
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:06,392
Nick:
Jonas! Get your hands off me!

1188
01:17:06,546 --> 01:17:08,810
Jonas! Get out of the car!
Jonas!

1189
01:17:08,968 --> 01:17:10,716
Get out of the car! Get off of me!

1190
01:17:14,517 --> 01:17:17,522
Ohh.

1191
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,411
Jonas!

1192
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,075
Jonas.

1193
01:17:38,631 --> 01:17:41,040
I told you to handle this.

1194
01:17:41,195 --> 01:17:42,895
You didn't.

1195
01:17:43,047 --> 01:17:44,310
Now we have a jailed psychopath

1196
01:17:44,471 --> 01:17:47,365
that's managed to bring this
entire city to its knees.

1197
01:17:48,353 --> 01:17:50,675
One of my friends
was just murdered.

1198
01:17:51,557 --> 01:17:54,734
More than one of my friends
is gone, Mayor.

1199
01:17:54,905 --> 01:17:57,227
What I should do is fire you.

1200
01:17:57,398 --> 01:17:59,467
hmm?
Right now.

1201
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,775
I resign.

1202
01:18:02,953 --> 01:18:06,382
- ls that your real answer?
- I think that's best.

1203
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:11,930
No.

1204
01:18:12,853 --> 01:18:14,775
I'm not gonna allow that to happen.
Bring me the Bible.

1205
01:18:14,954 --> 01:18:18,703
I'm not gonna let some criminal decide
whether Philadelphia has a DA or not.

1206
01:18:18,871 --> 01:18:20,911
As of now, you're acting
District Attorney.

1207
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:23,634
We'll have a formal
swearing in later.

1208
01:18:23,785 --> 01:18:26,504
For now this will suffice.
Stand up.

1209
01:18:27,987 --> 01:18:30,056
Put your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

1210
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:31,756
Repeat after me.

1211
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,581
- l, Nicolas Rice...
- l, Nicolas Rice...

1212
01:18:33,756 --> 01:18:35,475
- ... do solemnly swear...
- ... do solemnly swear...

1213
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:37,139
- ... that I will support...
- ... that I will support...

1214
01:18:37,317 --> 01:18:38,210
- ... obey...
- ... obey...

1215
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:40,649
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

1216
01:18:40,807 --> 01:18:42,390
...and defend the
Constitution of the United States...

1217
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:45,048
...and the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...

1218
01:18:52,772 --> 01:18:55,122
People aren't going to work;
kids aren't going to school.

1219
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,368
They're scared,
and I don't blame them.

1220
01:18:57,543 --> 01:19:01,118
So I'm implementing the emergency
provision of the Philadelphia code.

1221
01:19:01,282 --> 01:19:02,350
We're gonna lock this city down.

1222
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:05,219
Starting now, no one moves
in this city unrestricted.

1223
01:19:05,627 --> 01:19:07,609
I want a show of force
for the public-

1224
01:19:07,763 --> 01:19:09,939
uniforms, detectives,
12-hour shifts.

1225
01:19:10,114 --> 01:19:11,697
Put an armed cop on every corner.

1226
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:14,063
If you have to give shotguns
to the meter maids, do it.

1227
01:19:14,244 --> 01:19:15,993
There should be no doubt
in people's minds

1228
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:18,945
that this city is secure
and under our control.

1229
01:19:21,544 --> 01:19:22,981
Okay.

1230
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:30,859
Okay, Clyde.
l get it.

1231
01:19:34,044 --> 01:19:36,647
Dunnigan: Listen, that contraption
that killed Cantrell,

1232
01:19:36,821 --> 01:19:39,570
it was a weaponized
bomb-disposal robot.

1233
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:40,605
Can you believe that?

1234
01:19:40,774 --> 01:19:43,241
Damn thing had video, night vision-
you name it.

1235
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:46,041
It's like military API,
for Christ's sakes.

1236
01:19:46,222 --> 01:19:48,660
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

1237
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:50,434
I think he's saving you for last.

1238
01:19:52,739 --> 01:19:54,750
Nick, I'm serious.

1239
01:19:56,194 --> 01:19:58,660
I appreciate the insight.

1240
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:04,715
Nick, you gotta get in front of
this guy if you want to stay alive.

1241
01:20:07,162 --> 01:20:08,880
I may have a way-

1242
01:20:09,048 --> 01:20:12,079
something a friend
is helping me out with.

1243
01:20:12,254 --> 01:20:13,409
Who's your friend?

1244
01:20:13,571 --> 01:20:15,775
A friend named Chester.
I'll call you back.

1245
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:19,239
Thank you, Sarah.

1246
01:20:25,608 --> 01:20:27,900
This is Nick.
Give me the real-estate listing

1247
01:20:28,065 --> 01:20:30,959
of every industrial property sold
here in the last 10 years.

1248
01:20:52,778 --> 01:20:54,818
Motherfucker.

1249
01:21:10,512 --> 01:21:12,008
You're kidding me, right?

1250
01:21:12,897 --> 01:21:14,937
You're saying Clyde
owns this place?

1251
01:21:15,105 --> 01:21:17,572
Something about it
sticks out, right?

1252
01:21:17,741 --> 01:21:19,353
Yeah.

1253
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:24,760
What- are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1254
01:21:25,789 --> 01:21:28,819
- What about his civil rights?
- Fuck his civil rights.

1255
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:32,956
Yes!

1256
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:13,409
There's got to be
something in here.

1257
01:22:13,577 --> 01:22:15,014
Dunnigan: Yeah.

1258
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:30,667
Remember this from
outside the house?

1259
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:37,938
Yeah.

1260
01:22:38,113 --> 01:22:39,695
Get that right there.

1261
01:22:53,888 --> 01:22:56,180
Dunnigan:
Un-fucking-believable.

1262
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:09,777
Look at this.

1263
01:23:14,329 --> 01:23:15,912
Nick:
Watch your step.

1264
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:22,693
This guy tunneled into prison?

1265
01:23:46,377 --> 01:23:48,300
Nick:
Oh, shit.

1266
01:23:52,538 --> 01:23:54,238
Dunnigan:
Fuck- Semtex.

1267
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,940
Got police uniforms,
other disguises.

1268
01:24:21,133 --> 01:24:22,852
Nick:
he tunneled into every cell.

1269
01:24:23,732 --> 01:24:25,169
Over here.

1270
01:24:30,605 --> 01:24:32,752
he wanted to be
transferred to solitary.

1271
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,212
Surprise, motherfucker.

1272
01:25:11,878 --> 01:25:14,510
- he's not here!
- If he's not there, then where is he?

1273
01:25:19,427 --> 01:25:20,777
Nomos, what happened to your eye?

1274
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:22,202
Oh, long story.

1275
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:24,879
Stop right there, sir.

1276
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:26,831
Let me see your ID, please.

1277
01:25:27,012 --> 01:25:28,731
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1278
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,046
Turn around, sir.
Extend your arms.

1279
01:25:32,532 --> 01:25:33,882
Something going on tonight?

1280
01:25:34,063 --> 01:25:36,957
- The mayor.
- Mmm, mayor.

1281
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:45,093
Look at this.

1282
01:25:45,245 --> 01:25:47,313
he tapped into the prison cameras.

1283
01:25:47,488 --> 01:25:49,236
Jesus, he's got
cameras everywhere.

1284
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:50,878
- Shit.
- ls that your house?

1285
01:25:51,049 --> 01:25:53,457
Yes.

1286
01:25:54,325 --> 01:25:56,393
Baby, please tell me you're okay.

1287
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:57,783
Denise- where is she?

1288
01:25:57,958 --> 01:25:59,394
ls she with you?
Are you sure?

1289
01:25:59,559 --> 01:26:01,026
Okay.

1290
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:03,266
Stay where you are.
I'll explain later.

1291
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,966
I love you.

1292
01:26:13,555 --> 01:26:15,419
Nick:
Von Clausewitz.

1293
01:26:19,288 --> 01:26:20,580
Look at that.

1294
01:26:26,908 --> 01:26:28,404
he's at City hall.

1295
01:26:29,721 --> 01:26:31,440
You're free to go, sir.

1296
01:26:31,609 --> 01:26:34,163
- Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
- No, don't worry about it.

1297
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:37,588
Better to be safe
than sorry, right?

1298
01:26:38,873 --> 01:26:40,592
Dunnigan:
Get ready to evacuate the building.

1299
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:42,461
We'll need a tactical unit
and a bomb squad.

1300
01:26:42,612 --> 01:26:43,652
Bad idea.
have them come in soft.

1301
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:46,087
If Shelton spots them or
any of us, we're fucked.

1302
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,323
hey.

1303
01:27:10,531 --> 01:27:11,880
- Where's the tactical team?
- En route.

1304
01:27:12,062 --> 01:27:13,927
- They're coming in soft- no sirens.
- Bomb squad?

1305
01:27:14,092 --> 01:27:15,384
You're looking at it.

1306
01:27:15,552 --> 01:27:18,330
Right, okay. We take the north surge;
you take the west.

1307
01:27:18,508 --> 01:27:19,693
We'll call.

1308
01:27:24,027 --> 01:27:25,348
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- IDs, please.

1309
01:27:25,522 --> 01:27:27,562
- he's the fucking DA.
- Good for him. IDs, please.

1310
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:29,430
What's going on here tonight?

1311
01:27:29,582 --> 01:27:31,447
- Security meeting with all the brass.
- What floor?

1312
01:27:31,612 --> 01:27:33,223
6th floor- caucus room.

1313
01:27:35,743 --> 01:27:38,919
- What floor is this?
- That's the 5th floor, sir.

1314
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,809
Directly below the caucus room.

1315
01:27:40,978 --> 01:27:44,154
You catch this motherfucker red-handed,
we gotta take him alive.

1316
01:28:03,056 --> 01:28:04,581
Where is he?

1317
01:28:04,765 --> 01:28:06,941
What the fuck are we looking for?

1318
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:08,864
Wait wait wait.

1319
01:28:09,038 --> 01:28:10,048
Right there.

1320
01:28:10,213 --> 01:28:12,506
Garza: Stand back.
Don't touch anything.

1321
01:28:13,632 --> 01:28:15,953
It wasn't exactly my first instinct.

1322
01:28:49,277 --> 01:28:50,977
Can I see your ID, please?

1323
01:28:57,005 --> 01:28:59,016
All right, next car, pull forward!

1324
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,521
Garza:
Malglinite.

1325
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:33,807
That's napalm, basically.
This shit'll take out the entire floor

1326
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:35,493
and the one above us.

1327
01:29:35,678 --> 01:29:39,087
Looks like it's- looks like it's
triggered by this cell phone here.

1328
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:42,726
What?
So an incoming call arms it?

1329
01:29:42,907 --> 01:29:46,258
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds
till boom time.

1330
01:29:47,144 --> 01:29:49,067
- Jesus.
- Dunnigan, what are you doing?

1331
01:29:49,245 --> 01:29:50,653
- I'm calling the mayor's security.
- We can't.

1332
01:29:50,812 --> 01:29:53,677
Clyde is watching. he sees him evacuate
and he will detonate this thing.

1333
01:29:53,839 --> 01:29:56,044
We don't tell the mayor anything.

1334
01:29:58,290 --> 01:30:00,126
So what do we do?

1335
01:30:08,974 --> 01:30:10,352
Man:
Wait a second.

1336
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,123
We've got something.

1337
01:30:12,285 --> 01:30:13,839
Man over radio:
he's pulling up.

1338
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,480
Man:
Mayor April henry.

1339
01:30:42,696 --> 01:30:44,959
Thank you for coming in
on short notice.

1340
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:51,923
Mayor:
l have one simple question.

1341
01:30:54,055 --> 01:30:56,610
Why is Clyde Shelton still in my city?

1342
01:30:58,294 --> 01:31:00,071
Now I refuse to believe

1343
01:31:00,252 --> 01:31:04,001
that one man is smarter
than homeland Security,

1344
01:31:04,169 --> 01:31:07,918
the FBI, the sheriff's department,
or Philly PD.

1345
01:31:08,086 --> 01:31:09,980
I don't care how we do it,
or what kind

1346
01:31:10,152 --> 01:31:12,900
of obscure legal justification
we have to invoke, gentlemen.

1347
01:31:13,072 --> 01:31:15,646
I don't care what laws
we have to bend.

1348
01:31:15,813 --> 01:31:19,136
I am sure that there is a provision
of the homeland Security Act

1349
01:31:19,304 --> 01:31:21,479
that we can activate.

1350
01:31:21,653 --> 01:31:24,286
Just get him out of here
by tomorrow.

1351
01:31:30,057 --> 01:31:31,320
Nick: Clyde?

1352
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:36,972
Nick.

1353
01:31:37,144 --> 01:31:38,756
I wasn't expecting company.

1354
01:31:41,702 --> 01:31:44,334
Yeah, I would have-
l would have cleaned up a little.

1355
01:31:44,515 --> 01:31:46,866
Never seen anybody
tunnel into prison before.

1356
01:31:51,851 --> 01:31:55,202
And the solitary confinement?
That was clever.

1357
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:57,358
Well, that's how winners play.

1358
01:31:57,513 --> 01:32:00,204
We convince the other guy
he's making all the right moves.

1359
01:32:01,074 --> 01:32:03,191
So did you ever catch my accomplice?

1360
01:32:03,353 --> 01:32:04,732
Yeah, I did.

1361
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,931
It's the end of the road
for you now.

1362
01:32:10,724 --> 01:32:12,900
You played us, Clyde.
You played us real good.

1363
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:14,658
Thank you.

1364
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:17,394
You know, I'm glad you finally
get to appreciate

1365
01:32:17,561 --> 01:32:19,173
some of the effort that
l put into all of this.

1366
01:32:19,342 --> 01:32:21,236
Well, you set out to
make a point, Clyde.

1367
01:32:21,408 --> 01:32:22,301
You made it.

1368
01:32:22,476 --> 01:32:23,913
No, people still don't get it.

1369
01:32:24,078 --> 01:32:27,254
They don't appreciate what I'm trying
to say, Nick, but they will soon enough.

1370
01:32:27,426 --> 01:32:29,009
A man I cared about
once told me

1371
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:31,006
that we can't retract
the decisions that we've made,

1372
01:32:31,165 --> 01:32:33,311
we can only affect the decisions
we're going to make from here.

1373
01:32:33,479 --> 01:32:35,830
- Are you trying to save me now, Nick?
- I'm giving you a way out.

1374
01:32:36,007 --> 01:32:37,357
Big difference.

1375
01:32:37,539 --> 01:32:39,288
Stand up for those principles
you've been preaching.

1376
01:32:39,462 --> 01:32:42,492
See, we're all held accountable, Clyde.
That includes you.

1377
01:32:42,667 --> 01:32:44,046
Why don't we do
the right thing here?

1378
01:32:44,946 --> 01:32:47,063
I'm doing the right thing, Nick.

1379
01:32:48,792 --> 01:32:50,171
You just have to see it that way.

1380
01:32:50,359 --> 01:32:51,514
By murdering all those people,

1381
01:32:51,676 --> 01:32:54,085
all you're doing is
destroying the memory of your daughter

1382
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:57,241
and causing the same pain
that you're suffering from.

1383
01:46:13,455 --> 01:46:17,307
So what do you suggest, Nick?
Make another deal?

1384
01:46:17,479 --> 01:46:20,154
One final offer?
ls that what it is?

1385
01:46:22,784 --> 01:46:25,988
I don't make deals with
murderers anymore, Clyde.

1386
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:27,896
You taught me that.

1387
01:46:31,894 --> 01:46:35,127
Finally.

1388
01:46:37,052 --> 01:46:39,287
Well done. Bravo.

1389
01:46:39,467 --> 01:46:42,032
Maybe I wasn't such
a bad teacher after all.

1390
01:46:42,211 --> 01:46:44,126
If you go through with this, Clyde,
it's a decision

1391
01:46:44,296 --> 01:46:46,531
you'll have to live with
for the rest of your life.

1392
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:09,117
I'm sorry, Nick.

1393
01:47:11,479 --> 01:47:13,135
Me too.

1394
01:47:22,088 --> 01:47:23,714
Like I said, Clyde,

1395
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:26,446
it's a decision you'll have to
live with for the rest of your life,

1396
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:29,538
which I figure by now
is about 25 more seconds.
